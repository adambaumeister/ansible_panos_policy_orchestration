This repository provides a framework and a philosophy for creating PAN-OS security policies
via Automation.

This repository would be of interest to you if:

 * You deal with a large number of incoming user requests for security policy
 * You can make repeatable, actionable policy decisions 
 * You are comfortable with Ansible or General automation platforms.

## Quickstart

### Requirements

 * 🐍 Python 3.11+
 * Ansible 2.16+

```shell
ansible-galaxy install paloaltonetworks.panos
```

```shell
# ssh
git clone git@github.com:adambaumeister/ansible_panos_policy_orchestration.git
# https

### Define your Inventory

```yaml title='inventory.yml'
all:
  children:
    # the `lab` group is included here as an example, but you can layout your panorama devices however you like.
    # Note you will need to create your own primary playbook mirroring `lab_policy.yml` if you change the grouping.
    lab:
      hosts:
        lab-panorama01:
          ansible_host: < YOUR PANORAMA HOSTNAME OR IP HERE >
          # Password should be provided via PAN_PASSWORD environment variable
          # Example: export PAN_PASSWORD="admin_password"
          
          # Username should be provided via PAN_USERNAME environment variable
          # Example: export PAN_USERNAME="admin"
      vars:
        # Common variables for lab environment
        ansible_connection: local
        ansible_python_interpreter: "{{ ansible_playbook_python }}"
        # These variables are only used when creating COMPLETELY NEW policies
        default_new_policy_device_group: Lab
        default_new_policy_rulebase: post-rulebase
        default_new_policy_tag: AUTOMATED
        default_rule_location: bottom
```
